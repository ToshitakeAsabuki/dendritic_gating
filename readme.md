# Dendritic Gating Recurrent Network

These codes are written in python3. We ran the codes with numpy 1.15.3, scipy 1.1.0 and matplotlib 3.0.1. For each code, the simulation will finish within 1 h on a normal desktop computer.

・recgatnet.py : Learning complex sequences of spike patterns. Running this code generates figures for output raster plots and the average firing rate. Example results are shown in Fig. 3b. All results except FIg.7 were generated by this code with modified input sequences.

・recgatnet.py : Learning redundant representation by multi dendrite model. Running this code generates figures for receptive fields of each dendrite and its activities. Example results are shown in Fig. 7. # dendritic_gating
